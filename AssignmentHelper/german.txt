They  loved  each  other
They  loved  each  other,  but  neither
Would  admit  to  the  other  they  could:
As  enemies,  they  saw  each  other,
And  almost  died  of  their  love.
In  the  end  they  parted  and  only
Saw  each  other  sometimes  in  dreams:
It  was  long  ago  they  had  died,
But  they  scarcely  knew  it,  it  seems.

ENGLISH:
All  that  is  gold  does  not  glitter
All  that  is  gold  does  not  glitter
Not  all  those  who  wander  are  lost
The  old  that  is  strong  does  not  wither
Deep  roots  are  not  reached  by  the  frost.
From  the  ashes  a  fire  shall  be  woken
A  light  from  the  shadows  shall  spring
Renewed  be  the  blade  that  was  broken
The  crownless  again  shall  be  king.

Es  liegt  der  heiße  Sommer
Auf  deinen  Wängelein;

Du  Vielgeliebte  mein!
Der  Winter  wird  auf  den  Wangen,
Der  Sommer  im  Herzen  sein.

Summer  in  your  heart.

Alles  Leid  und  Schmerzen  stillest,

Doppelt  mit  Erquickung  füllest;

Was  soll  all  der  Schmerz  und  Lust?
Süßer  Friede,
Komm,  ach  komm  in  meine  Brust!

Why  this  pain  and  desire?
Peace  descending
Come  ah,  come  into  my  breast!
